Warm Up

As always, begin with a light warm-up. A few minutes of light cardio, like jumping jacks or a light jog, and some dynamic stretching exercises for your hips, hamstrings, and lower back can be beneficial.
Setup

Approach the barbell so that it is centered over your feet. Your feet should be about hip-width apart.

Bend at the hip to grip the bar. While some people prefer a mixed grip (one hand overhand, one hand underhand), for the purposes of learning, start with both palms facing you (double overhand grip).

Your grip should be shoulder-width. Arms should be positioned just outside the legs. Your back should be straight, not rounded.

The Pull

Lower your hips, flexing the knees until your shins contact the bar.

Take a deep breath, brace your core, and begin the movement by driving through the heels, extending your hips and knees.

Maintain a flat back throughout the lift, with your head in a neutral position. The bar should remain close to your body the entire time.

Once the bar passes your knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.

Stand tall and straight with the bar in your hands.

Lowering the Bar

Lower the bar by bending at the hips, maintaining a straight back.

Once the bar is past your knees, bend your knees and return the bar to the ground.

Repeat

This completes one rep. Repeat the steps for your intended number of reps.
