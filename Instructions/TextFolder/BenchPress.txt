Step 1: Preparation

Position yourself: Lay down on the bench, ensuring that your feet are flat on the ground, providing a stable base. Your back should be against the bench, with a slight arch in your lower back. The arch should be small enough that you can slide your hand under your lower back.
Align your body: Your eyes should be under the bar. This is the starting point.
Grip: Place your hands on the bar with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your grip should be such that your forearms are vertical when the bar is in the bottom position. Your wrists should be straight and strong, not bent backwards.
Hand position: Wrap your thumbs around the bar for a secure grip.
Step 2: Un-racking the Bar

Take a deep breath, brace your core, and push the bar off the rack, straightening your arms.
Move the bar directly above your chest, keeping your wrists straight.
Step 3: Lowering the Bar

Lower the bar to your mid-chest (just above your sternum). Do this slowly and in a controlled manner. Your elbows should be at about a 45-75 degree angle from your torso.
Keep your feet, glutes, and shoulders in contact with the ground/bench the entire time.
Inhale as you lower the bar.
Step 4: Pressing the Bar

Once the bar reaches your chest, pause briefly without bouncing the bar off your chest.
Push the bar back to the starting position as you exhale. The motion should be smooth, without jerking or straining.
Step 5: Racking the Bar

Once you've completed your set, you'll need to re-rack the bar. Move it back towards the rack, aim for the lower part of the rack.
Once it's securely on the rack, you can release your grip.
